MARTIN LAU'S PROGRESS FILE

Role: Project coordinator / middleman between all groups
--------
WEEK 8: 20/11/23 - 26/11/23
Preliminary planning, role and group attribution to different members
Research about potential build structures

WEEK 9: 27/11/23 - 03/12/23
Starting to get front end side to work
Finally managed to install emsdk, put it in path and get it to work with WebAssembly

Next tasks:
Build proper UI for the app, logic behind it
After: Connect UI logic with server communication

WEEK 10: 04/11/23 - 10/12/23
Setting up app UI project
Learning how to use QML and UI is harder than I thought, I found a decently large manual to learn and understand how to use it, but it might take a while...
Experimenting and tinkering with buttons and how to connect them to C++ functions.

WEEK 11: 11/12/23 - 17/12/23
Learning more about QML
Ditching the .ui and the design studio approach, QML is more functional and simpler to use and integrate with C++. Besides, we need a working thing soon.

WEEK 12: 18/12/23 - 24/12/23
Monday: finally getting a base app working. Includes page transitions and elementary c++ integration.
Thursday: reorganizing the github repo, removing redundant branches.
Organizing the team so that they can start building the pages during the holidays.
Beginning testing with Figma and how we can implement these designs within the project.
Need a more robust framework with how c++ and qml is to be integrated together.

HOLIDAY WEEK 1: 25/12/23 - 31/12/23
Monday (Merry Christmas!)
edits were made on branch 'martin-settings-profile'.
Finally setting up the QML basis - things are finally starting to look brighter.
Set up elementary QML functions for the first two pages of the application

TODO:
reorganize file names for the different QML pages so that everything will be easier to work with (e.g. change "Menu1.qml" -> "Market.qml")
Use replace on the stackView instead of push and pop, works faster and is more flush
Replace the janky default transitions on the stackview on main.qml
Once finished, port these changes onto other's branches and ask them to complete cpp functions for their respective pages

Later on
CPP functions to link with the homepage etc - talk to other team members to see how to integrate each parts.
Make this thing look sexy


HOLIDAY WEEK 2: 01/01/24 - 07/01/24
Monday (Happy new year!)
Edits made on branch 'martin-settings-profile' 
Editing QML style

Added 'profile' page to differentiate from settings (also because I couldn't figure out how to make separate sub menus in one popup lmao)
Merging CPP files from branch 'front' to the project - reconfiguring the project to accomodate these edits

Coordinating with the team how to reorganize the workload - getting everyone to do cpp coding and have the project be completed more efficiently
File reorganization on the github repo
Going to implement C++ functions to update user settings and profile options.

Checking with team on updates - everyone is on holiday, understandably.

WEEK 13:  08/01/24 - 14/01/24
Monday team meeting: coming together, formulating new plan to finish and link the project progress together.
Starting work on the telegram bot: obtaining API, starting out the Telegram bot development branch.

Implementing the given functions from Sixtine to link QML and CPP logic together.
The code is currently very buggy and cannot compile due to an unforseen bug done by a careless ~~whisper~~ commit.


WEEK 14: 15/01/24 - 21/01/24
Working on merging 3-4 different branches together, and resolving conflicts
Implementing logic properly into QML buttons.

Final week: 21/01/24-31/01/24
Could not get much done this week, due to strong sickness making me bedridden. After I recovered, I worked with the team on the presentation, did some final tweaks to the project, and finish the final release of the project. 

We also attempted to start converting the <code>app-release</code> project into CMake, but we did not have enough time to fix all the compilation errors, so the app and the server will remain separated.

Also wrote up most of the readme file for examiners to read.
