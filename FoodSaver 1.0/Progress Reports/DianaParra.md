**Weekly Progress Reports**

**Week 1: 20/11 - 24/11**
Since I'm part of the Web Interface/App team, we began by discussing some main elements of what we would like to include visually in the interface of our project. I helped to create a draft of what we want the main page to look like, and also started discussing possible alternatives to how we could start coding it.

**Week 2: 27/11 - 01/12**
I struggled with downloading some of the extensions that we need to make a Qt Quick Application, which we figured out was the best approach to try and create our project for it to be able to be modified from Android and iOS. I didn't manage to make all the downloads and installs, but after asking one of the TAs and my teammates, I had what I needed to keep trying at home.

**Week 3: 4/12 - 8/12**
I managed to make progress in the install of extensions so I began with attempts to start building basic functions to make an app with Qt Quick. At first I also had a problem with understanding all the kits I should include and with the versions of Qt, but at the end I believe I made something work just fine for the first attempt. For future plans I would like to start exploring the visuals a bit more, so we can discuss next week as a team and know everyone's vision as well as being realistic about what to expect from our team and viceversa.

**Week 4: 11/12 - 15/12**
I dedicated much of this week to learn how to properly use github desktop so that my files would be properly updated from the main in order to make sure it was up to date with everyone's progress. Now that I had Qt working properly as well, I talked with Fanny and Antoine about possible implementations to the app through this days, in terms of display, etc.


**Week 5: 18/12 - 22/12**
At the end of the session, we discussed that I would be working specifically on the Market during the holidays and a branch "diana-marketpage" was created for me, where I have been trying out everything I have been needing so far.

**Week 8: 8/01 - 12/01**
This week I worked on catching up a little bit with the rest of the team with what progress we had made during the holidays. I must say that although the team was always communicating and talking, I drifted apart a little bit during this 2-week period. For this reason, I got together with Esma so we could figure out the functions needed to create a map of offers from the users so I could use this in the Market page to obtain every single offer and be able to display it. 

**Week 9: 15/01 - 19/01**
I finished the most important update of the visual look of the Market page, since I finally managed to create a model that would work as a try-out data base. I talked to Martin about possibly creating a database that would be already linked to the server so I could test this out in how the display would look like in the Market page, but figured evtually that it would be better to try manually and make sure the model and the repeater worked fine, so that's what I did. I also discussed with Sixtine about general information for the sorting functions I needed.

**Week 10: 22/01 - 26/01**
I managed to finish the Basket popup properly. I actually got to perfect the scrolling area on the Basket even more than with the Market itself, so this helped me to go bac and perfect even more the visuals. Through this week I worked with Antoine specifically to contemplate some possible links we could try to do between the fridge and when a user posts an offer so that it automatically saves this information in the main page for the market. We didn't manage to finish this link, but we discussed some ideas on how to make the project more seamless between pages. I created a "market-server" branch that I used to try and link functions I had previously worked on with Esma (she wrote them) and try out to make them work. However, since we we going for the "manual" database, I didn't dedicate much to this in the end.

**Week 11: 29/01 - 31/01 (Presentation Week)**
I did the finishing touches for the market place page and the link to the Basket. I finalized what I wanted, and what we discussed as a team that it would be better for the demonstration in the actual day of the presentation. I also tried my best to create a c++ function that could be the link to make the repeater properly work within the sorting functions, just as the fridge, but I decided not to include it in the main since it wasn't properly working. I also added the final button for the Basket that leads to the Telegram Bot, which thought it would be a nice idea for the presentation itself. This week we had many meetings and managed to talk with many front-end people about our concerns and they helped me fix bugs so that everything runs smoothly. :)
